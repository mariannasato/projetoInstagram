# 🤳 Instagram Page Project

## HTML/CSS Practice .03

This project was a 'code-from-scratch' of my instagram main page made as a practice around flex, different layouts and positioning. A cool function of it is the resposivity: this layout is 100% responsive for the three main viewports: desktop, tablet and mobile; just like the real website. It was made with HTML and CSS.
